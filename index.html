        <h1>LEARNING HTML</h1>
        <h2 id="intro">INTRO TO HTML</h2>
        <p>
          HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It's the backbone of a website, providing the structure and content that the web browser renders to the user. HTML consists of a series of elements, represented by tags (<>), which are used to define the different parts of a web page.
        </p>

        <h1 id="textformatting">HTML TEXT FORMATTING</h1>
        <p>
          HTML provides various elements to format text on a web page. Headings (h1-h6) are used to define headings, paragraphs (p) for body text, and bold (b or strong) and italic (i or em) for emphasis. Lists (ul, ol, li) are used to create unordered and ordered lists. Text alignment can be controlled using center, left, and right attributes.
        </p>
        <h1 id="Capabilities">HTML Capabilities</h1>
        <p>
          HTML is capable of creating web pages with structured content, including headings, paragraphs, images, and links. It can also embed multimedia content like audio and video. However, HTML has limitations, such as not being a programming language, which means it can't create dynamic content or interact with users.

        </p>
        <h1 id="navigationandlinks">HTML Navigation and Links</h1>
        <p>
          HTML uses anchor tags (a) to create hyperlinks, which allow users to navigate between web pages. The href attribute specifies the link destination. Links can be internal (within the same website), external (to other websites), email, or phone links. Navigation menus are created using unordered lists (ul) and list items (li).
          </p>

          <h1 id="workingwithimages">HTML Working with Graphics and Images</h1>
          <p>HTML uses the img tag to add images to web pages. The src attribute specifies the image source, and the alt attribute provides alternative text for accessibility. Common image formats include jpg, png, and gif. Graphics can be created using svg and canvas elements.
          </p>

          <h1 id="workingwithmedia">HTML Working with Media</h1>
          <p>HTML5 introduced the audio and video tags, making it easy to embed multimedia content. The audio tag supports mp3 and other formats, while the video tag supports mp4 and webm. Embedding media from other sources can be done using iframe and embed tags.</p>

          <h1 id="contentidentification">HTML Content Identification</h1>
          <p>HTML5 introduced semantic elements to define the structure of a web page. The header element defines the header section, footer defines the footer, and section defines a self-contained section. Article elements represent independent content, and nav elements define navigation sections.
          </p>

          <h1 id="intergration">HTML Integration</h1>
          <p>HTML is often used with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and layout, and JavaScript for interactivity and functionality. HTML5 features like semantic elements, multimedia, and canvas enhance the functionality of web pages.</p>

          <h1 id="workingwithform">HTML Working with Forms</h1>
          <p>HTML forms allow users to interact with web pages. The form tag defines a form, input fields (input) allow user input, and labels (label) provide text for input fields. Form validation attributes like required and pattern ensure user input meets specific criteria.</p>
          
           <h1 id="interactiveelements">HTML Interactive Elements</h1>
            <p></p>HTML provides various interactive elements, including buttons (button), dropdowns (select, option), checkboxes (input type="checkbox"), and radio buttons (input type="radio"). These elements allow users to interact with web pages.
            </p>

      <div>
        <h1 id="introCSS">1. Intro to CSS</h1>
<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to control the layout and appearance of web pages. It separates presentation from structure, allowing for more flexibility and maintainability. CSS is applied to HTML elements using selectors, properties, and values.</p>
<h1>Adding CSS Selectors</h1> 
<p id="cssselectors">CSS selectors target specific HTML elements for styling. Types of selectors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Element selectors (e.g., p, h1)</li>
<li>Class selectors (.class)</li>
<li>ID selectors (#id)</li>
<li>Attribute selectors ([attribute])</li>
<li>Pseudo-class selectors (:hover, :active)</li>
<li>Pseudo-elements selectors (::before, ::after)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="cssselectors">CSS Images and Colors</h1>
<h2>CSS is used to add images and control colors on web pages.</h2>
<ul>
<li> Background images: background-image, background-repeat, background-position</li>
<li> Foreground images: img, src</li>
 <li>Colors: color, background-color, hex codes, RGB, RGBA</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="cssboxestypes"> CSS Boxes, Types</h1>
<h2>CSS boxes model HTML elements as rectangular boxes.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Block-level elements (div, p): occupy full width, stack vertically</li>
<li>Inline elements (span, a): occupy only necessary width, stack horizontally</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="cssboxestypessizes">CSS Boxes, Sizes</h1>
<h2>CSS controls box sizes using:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Width and height properties</li>
<li>Box-sizing property (content-box, padding-box, border-box)</li>
<li>Margin and padding properties</li>
<li>Border property</li>
</ul>                                                                                                                           


<h1 id="csspropertiesandconcept"> Advanced CSS Properties and Concepts</h1>
 <h2>Advanced CSS topics include:</h2>
 <ul>
<li> Positioning: absolute, relative, fixed, sticky</li>
<li>Floating: float, clear</li>
 <li>Display: inline-block, flex, grid
